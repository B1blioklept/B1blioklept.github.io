<h1 id="hitchikers-guide-to-pirating-books-research-papers-and-other-textual-fuckery---the-guide-to-replace-me"><strong>Hitchiker&rsquo;s guide to pirating books, research papers, and other textual fuckery - the guide to replace me</strong></h1>
<hr>
<h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>
<p>Well <strong>fuckers</strong>, if you are reading this, it could only mean two things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1] You need some text-based material</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2] You are a broke cunt who cannot ejaculate a few bucks to satisfy your deepest desires</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are one of these, then this is the right place. Your Windows-loving, DRM-cucked, and chrome-using waste-of-human-flesh that you call a friend (or maybe it is you), might say &ldquo;Nuh-uh, piracy bad, pay money and give capitalism a good fellatio&rdquo;, but don&rsquo;t listen to them. Be a pirate, sail the seas ! Be such a good pirate, that Viswas&rsquo; entire existence is rendered futile (as though it weren&rsquo;t, till now).</p>

<h1 id="prerequisties-1">Prerequisties</h1>
<h2 id="pre-req-1--anonymity">Pre-req 1 : Anonymity</h2>
<p>If you are in India, DMCA strikes are not really a big deal. Also your ISP knows how petty you are. Therefore, you do not have to worry about anonymity. But say that you live elsewhere, then, a VPN or a Proxy would be decent. But that does not give you the right to use whichever god-forbidden VPN you want to use. There are certain VPNs that log userdata, which do not make them, well&hellip; <strong>PRIVATE</strong>.</p>
<p>A VPN that respects the P in the VPN would be based. <a href="https://riseup.net/vpn">RiseupVPN</a> is the only VPN that I can think of which respects privacy.</p>
<p>Proxies can also be used but rarely do you find good proxies. Furthermore, since this guide assumes you are so tech-retarded that you assume a CPU and a monitor are the same thing, let us not delve much more into proxies.</p>
<p>For the extremely paranoid and the klutzy, <a href="https://tails.net/">TailsOS</a> would suffice. But since this is not a privacy 101 class, you retards can read it up on your own.</p>
<h2 id="pre-req-2--do-not-use-chrome">Pre-req 2 : DO NOT USE CHROME</h2>
<p><strong>DO NOT, AND I FUCKING REPEAT SO THAT WINDOWS USERS CAN HEAR, DO NOT FOR FUCK&rsquo;S SAKE USE CHROME</strong>.</p>
<p>It is frankly appalling how most academics and people with room-temperature IQ use chrome. But all hail the holy <strong>BOTNET</strong>. Escape the fucking Matrix. Use a firefox <strong>based</strong> browser. Now a lot of self-proclaimed tech nomads might use this moment to shill Brave. But, my brothers and sisters in ICANN, do not listen to that malarkey.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, do not use firefox either. The clandestine clutches of the Matrix have reached our poor dear firefox. So, for now use iterations of firefox that concentrate on privacy.</p>
<p>Here are a few good examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://librewolf.net">Librewolf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iridiumbrowser.de/">Iridum Browser</a> * Chromium Based, but forgivable</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser/releases/tag/iceraven-2.15.2">Iceraven</a> * For android</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, there is a separate guide-cum-article by some good samaritan (like me) on the amount of spyware most browsers contain. Click <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/">here</a> to visit the website.</p>
<h2 id="pre-req-3--adblockers">Pre-req 3 : Adblockers</h2>
<p>Even genuine websites tend to be infested by ads and these are not choices that only website-makers make. The company that allows them to host their website can tamper with their html pages and let in advertisements. Either ways, it is up to us to ensure that we do not see ads everywhere (and it is up to me to ensure that I never see my ex again).</p>
<p>If you are good little boy/girl and have downloaded Librewolf as I had instructed you to, then you people won&rsquo;t have to worry about this part since Librewolf already comes with <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">UblockOrigin</a> preinstalled.</p>
<p>Unless you are a member of Julian Assange&rsquo;s mailing list or end up visiting too many nasty sites on purpose, <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">Ublock</a> will suffice. This is where Chrome and chromium based browsers kick their users in the balls. Google has implemented manifestV3 which renders adblockers as useless as an English degree.</p>
<h2 id="pre-req-4--common-fucking-sense">Pre-req 4 : Common-fucking-sense</h2>
<p>Now, this has to be emphasised since most of the people on the internet are avid consumers of social media, which by default makes a person impotent. Therefore, once you have technologically equipped yourself, ensure that your IQ is higher than the average age of all the citizen&rsquo;s of Epstein&rsquo;s little (emphasis on the little) Island</p>

<h1 id="chapter-1--books-general--specific-1">Chapter 1 : Books (General &amp; Specific)</h1>
<p>For general usage, popular alternatives will always suffice, but this guide attempts to teach people how to search books efficiently even on popular websites.</p>
<p>Certain rules have to be followed before mindlessly searching for a book. While a trial and error method might work, it is clearly not efficient (and harmful in certain instances, if you know what I mean). Here are a few rules.</p>
<h2 id="1-know-your-book-well">1. Know your book well</h2>
<p>When I say know your book well, I don&rsquo;t mean to take it out on a couple of dates, do your book&rsquo;s assignments and get nothing in return. Just know the book&rsquo;s ISBN. It is unique, like a fingerprint, and while a fingerprint might not reveal everything about a person, an ISBN will. There are two types of ISBN. ISBN-10 and ISBN-13. Now, although ISBN-13 reveals a bit more info, an ISBN-10 will suffice as well. To get the ISBN of a book, search for the book either on Amazon, Goodreads, or Wikipedia.</p>
<h2 id="2-know-your-sites">2. Know your sites</h2>
<p>Once you have the ISBN, it is all a matter of searching on specific websites before you get the book.</p>
<h5 id="annas-archivehttpsannas-archiveorg"><a href="https://annas-archive.org/">Anna&rsquo;s Archive</a></h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Anna&rsquo;s archive has certain slow download mirrors, which have to be used in case you wish for a free method to get books.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="zlibraryhttps1libsk-domain-subject-to-change-because-fuck-fbi"><a href="https://1lib.sk">Zlibrary</a> *Domain subject to change, because fuck FBI</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Zlibrary is a cult classic. But it now requires an account to download books. Make a burner account with a burner email using <a href="https://mail.tutanota.com">Tutanota</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="googles-advanced-csehttpscsegooglecomcsecx006516753008110874046s9ddesylrm8gsctab0"><a href="https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=006516753008110874046:s9ddesylrm8#gsc.tab=0">Google&rsquo;s Advanced CSE</a></h5>
<blockquote>
<p>The power of the world, the words of the downtrodden, the words of the reigning, the visions of the dreamers, all in your palms.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="oceanofpdfhttpsoceanofpdfcom"><a href="https://oceanofpdf.com/">Oceanofpdf</a></h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Not the best, but it is normie friendly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="pdfdrivehttpspdfdriveto"><a href="https://pdfdrive.to/">Pdfdrive</a></h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Does not deserve attention, like my wails of agony.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="3-unleash-the-torrent">3. Unleash the <strong>TORRENT</strong></h4>
<p>If the book you desire is not there on any of these websites, do not fret. Download <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qbittorrent</a>, install Python, go to their <a href="https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins">unofficial plugin website</a>and add the academic torrent search engine and then search for book with its title.</p>
<h4 id="4-go-rabid">4. Go rabid</h4>
<p>If, <em>despite multiple attempts</em> (sobs internally), there is no result, then, do one thing. Open a search engine keep searching for the book along with multiple keywords to narrow your search. The &lsquo;filetype:pdf&rsquo; or &lsquo;filetype:epub&rsquo; might help.</p>
<h4 id="5-curl-into-a-ball-and-cry-till-death-claims-you-or-find-an-alternative-book">5. Curl into a ball and cry till death claims you or find an alternative book</h4>
<p>If, in the end you are faced with the honest painful truth (I mean of not finding your book), then exhale cinematically, drink some water, turn off the lights, go to the corner of your room and cry till you can&rsquo;t even breathe. It usually works.</p>
<h4 id="6-specialised-books">6. Specialised Books</h4>
<h5 id="fmhy-indexhttpsgithubcomfmhyfmhywikif09f9397-books---comics---manga"><a href="https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/%F0%9F%93%97-Books---Comics---Manga">FMHY Index</a></h5>
<p>If you can read English and understand basic website hierarchy, then fuck off from this guide and go through this. Everything in life is replaceable and so is the guide. Every treasure that you chance upon will have a superior competitor, a competitor with lustre enough to make you feel ashamed of yourself and kill yourself.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-2--research-papers-1">Chapter 2 : Research Papers</h1>
<p>Research papers by academics have been paywalled in such a way that it is neither lucrative for the concerned research scholar of those that subscribe to the paywall. Publishers have been feeding off on our money and that is depressing for two reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, it defeats the entire purpose of an open-world. Royalties for the research scholar makes sense but does an arbitrarily valued pice of paper decide the worth of another corpse of some poor tree but with actual information.</p>
<p>Secondly, I hate paywalls. Now, since external validation is too much to ask for, manning the fuck up and internally validating myself, I have decided that my words and opinions are worth lending an ear to.</p>

<h3 id="doi---digital-object-identifier">DOI - Digital Object Identifier</h3>
<p>To successfully pirate research papers, you first need to know the DOI of the paper. It is usually present on the parent website of the paper or has been mentioned in the paper/whatever-the-fuck that cites the paper. If there is no DOI, then there is either a PMID or some other unique digital identifier that would help you to search for the paper without typing in the whole name of the paper.</p>
<h3 id="sites">Sites</h3>
<p>There are not too many stellar sites save for two. Apart from that there are only a few and those can be found on the FMHY index (refer to section 6 of chapter 1).</p>
<p>Here are the list of sites</p>

<p>A website as perseverant as my pathethic nature.</p>

<p>Since scihub contantly updates its mirrors, owing to glowie crackdown, the link here has been &lsquo;hreffed&rsquo; to Scihub&rsquo;s wikipedia page.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-3--authors-agony-1">Chapter 3 : Author&rsquo;s agony</h1>
<p>One of the hardest truths I had to ever face in life is that every connection in life is transanctional. A lot of optimistic cunts might say otherwise, but even obsession is transanctional. You obsess over something only if it gives you the high. Only if if makes you feel different. This entire world is a conscpicuous and inconscpicous cauldron of barter trade. Parents love you in hopes of something, and this something depends on your parents. Significant others love each other since they make each other comfortable. Now, inspired yet not mentally corrupted by Marx or Arthur Shelby, I opine that we are all prositutes. Harlots offering whatever we can offer, hoping some customer likes our idiosyncracy. From a person who could never have any loyal customers, I only ask you people reading this guide for one thing. <strong>Epistemologically whore yourself out</strong>. True knowledge is hard to come by these days. Everything, including this guide has been infested by the vanities of the ever growing world. Be it infected or uninfected, knowledge is knowledge. Give it to everyone.</p>
<p>The respite of reading books has lost its value to me, but for the ones that have a <strong>long way to go</strong> and have the perseverance to go forward, this guide is for you. This might not be good enough, but it is a spark that could either ignite a forest fire, or be snuffed out (like my hopes of a better life).</p>
