SFI EFLU condemns and opposes the implementation of the unconstitutional CAA. Catering to the Hindutva communal agenda, the act undermines the fundamental principles of our constitution. Together with the nation, SFI EFLU opposes the Central Governmentâ€™s notification to implement the act in the wake of the Parliament elections.
