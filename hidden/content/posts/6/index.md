Today marks the 141st death anniversary of Karl Marx. A true revolutionary, whose life constantly reminds us that not only should we advocate for a social order in which everyone lives with equality and contentment, but also to join the revolutionary struggle for it. Marx was not an economist or a political thinker alone. He set out a revolutionary philosophy, a philosophy, the scope of which covers not only politics but the whole of human history, economics, society and nature. But that philosophy which is a combination of the dialectical method with materialism created a powerful combination of theory and practice which can bring about revolutionary transformation.

As Marx himself said “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it”.
